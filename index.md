## An intro to R for new programmers

This is an introduction to R. I promise, this will be fun.  Since you have never used a programming language before, or any for that matter, you won't be tainted by real progamming languages like `Python` or `Java`. This is good - we can teach you the R way of doing things. 


## What will we do?

* Using the R console - let's dig our claws in
* vector's - the basic R data structure
* data.frame's - weird but familiar
* [lists](#lists)
* functions
* Using packages
* Data! Cat's love open data
* [Reading](#reading)
