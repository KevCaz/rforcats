## An intro to R for new programmers

This is an introduction to R. I promise this will be fun.  Since you have never used a programming language before, or any for that matter, you won't be tainted by real progamming languages like `Python` or `Java`. This is good - we can teach you the R way of doing things.

Yep, this is a total rip off of [JSforcats.com](http://jsforcats.com).

Writing code is fun. Since you're a cat, not having opposable thumbs may be a bit of an issue, but surely you're clever enough to find a way around that. 

So open up R, and you'll see something like this:

You can do math:

```{r, background='#dfe3e3'}
1 + 1
```

Type a set of letters together (also known as a _word_) within quotes and the console will print it back to you

```{r}
"Hello Mr Tickles"
```

## <a href="#dataframes" name="dataframes"/>#</a> Data.frame's

A `data.frame` is one of the most commonly used objects in R. Just think of a `data.frame` like a table, or a spreadsheet, with rows and columns and numbers, text, etc. in the cells. A very special thing about the `data.frame` in R is that it can handle multiple types of data - that is, each column can have a different type. Like in the below table the first column is of `numeric` type, the second a `factor`, and the third `character`. 

```

```

## <a href="#functions" name="functions"/>#</a> Functions

XXXX

## <a href="#packages" name="packages"/>#</a> Using packages

XXXX

## <a href="#data" name="data"/>#</a> Data from the web

Install `cowsay`

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
install_github("sckott/cowsay")
```

Now let's get a cat fact!

```{r}
library("cowsay")
say("catfact", "cat")
```
A little explanation is in order me thinks. There are a few things going on in the last thing we just did. The `say` function looks like sorta like this:

```coffee
say <- function(what, by, type){
  <== some ascii art ==>
  url <- "http://catfacts-api.appspot.com/api/facts?number=1"
  what <- fromJSON(url)$facts
  message(sprintf(by, what))
}
```

The first line is a bunch of ascii characters to make a cat. The second line defines the url for the cat facts API. The third line retrieves one cat fact from the cat facts API. And the fourth line prints the messages with a cat. 

> But what is an API? I'm a cat, I only drink water or milk (preferably milk) - but at least I've heard of an IPA. What the rat's ass (yum) is an API. 

Okay, here goes. An API stands for Application Programming Interface. It's just a set of instructions for two computers to talk to each other. It's sorta like if you run into another cat and if you both knew beforehand a lot about each other, you would have a sense for how to behave - if you don't know each other, then best of luck to you Mr. Tickles.
